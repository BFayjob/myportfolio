            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Driven by a passion for cybersecurity and a commitment to
            excellence, I am on a journey to become a Cloud Security Engineer.
            My journey commenced over a year ago with a pivotal internship at
            MTN Telecommunications PLC, where I honed my skills in network
            monitoring, vulnerability assessment, and incident response, laying
            the groundwork for my commitment to cybersecurity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In 2023, I transitioned to Software Engineering, spearheading a
            successful projectâ€”an inventory management web app for my parents
            company. This endeavor ignited my passion for web development,
            forming the bedrock of my software development skills, particularly
            with popular frameworks like React.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Expanding my horizons, I ventured into cloud technologies, hosting
            the web app on AWS and Google Firebase. Despite my diverse skill
            set, my heart remains in cybersecurity. With businesses increasingly
            migrating to the cloud, I am positioning myself to be an expert at
            the intersection of cloud and security.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            My professional journey reflects a fusion of hands-on cybersecurity
            experience and adept software development skills. As I actively seek
            opportunities, I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects and
            collaborate with exceptional individuals. I am excited to take on
            the challenges ahead and contribute to creating secure cloud
            solutions.
